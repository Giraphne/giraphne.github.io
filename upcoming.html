<h2>SIGCSE 2023</h2>
<i>Toronto, Canada, 15-18 March</i>
<p>It's still far away, but in March I'll be visiting Toronto. This is going to be my first experience at SIGCSE. It is much bigger than ICER, which might make it a bit harder to network. On the other hand, there are so many interesting events on the calendar that I should always be able to find someone with similar interests to me! At SIGCSE, I'll present a paper I wrote together with Toni Taipalus and Fenia, on how students experience engagement in an introductory Database course. Before the conference, I'll also be visiting UofT's Missisauga campus and Michael Liut. I'm very much looking forward to this trip!</p>
