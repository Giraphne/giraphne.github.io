<p>Below, you can see upcoming events I'll attend. I hope to see you there!</p>

<!-- <p>Due to the current pandemic, all offline events have been cancelled. Once something new comes up, I'll add it here.</p> -->



<h3>SIGMOD 2022, DataEd workshop</h3>
<i>Philadelphia, USA, June 12-17</i>
<p>SIGMOD is a leading international conference for database researchers. Together with Fenia and George, we will host the <a href="dataedinitiative.github.io">DataEd workshop</a> on data systems education. The work I'm doing on SQL education has been well received in the Computer Science Education conferences, but should also be encouraged from the database side. After all, this is where we can valorize it. So, in an effort to bring the two communities closer together, we proposed this workshop. </p>

<h3>ICER 2022</h3>
<i>Lugano, Switzerland, August 7-11</i>
<p>ICER is an international conference for the Computer Science Education community. Now that it will be back in person, plus hosted in Europe, I look forward to attending in person for the first time. I had a good experience last year online, and hope that this year will be even better. </p>
