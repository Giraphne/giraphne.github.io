<p>Below, you can see my upcoming events. I hope to see you there!</p>

<!-- <p>Due to the current pandemic, all offline events have been cancelled. Once something new comes up, I'll add it here.</p> -->


<h3>VL/HCC 2021</h3>
<i>Online, October 11-13</i>
<p>VL/HCC is a conference on Visual Languages and Human-Centered Computing. It is a great fit for presenting our work on <a href="https://pypi.org/project/sqlvis/">SQLVis</a>, a visual representation for SQL. Our presentation is on Tuesday, and will take place at 14:40 Central Time, or 21:40 local time, in the session Visual Program and Information Representations (1).</p>


<h3>Alice & Eve 2021</h3>
<i>Nijmegen, the Netherlands, November 12</i>
<p>After a succesful first version in January 2020, and a postponement of the 2021 version, in November it is finally time for Alice & Eve. It is a workshop to celebrate women in computing in the Netherlands, and it is a good venue to meet other students, PhD candidates and other academics within the country. This network broadening is one of the reasons I enjoyed Alice and Eve 2020 so much. This year, I will have another poster to present some work under review. </p>

<h3>Koli Calling 2021</h3>
<i>Online, November 18-21</i>
<p>Koli Calling is a single-track, small-but-international conference on Computer Science Education. Giving it it's name is hotel Koli (in Finland), where this conference is typically held. I have not been to this conference before, but my co-promotor Fenia mentioned that it is a good venue for networking, which is what I hope to do. I'll have a poster (+ abstract) to present a study design that I hope to discuss with the Koli community before I run it next year. I hope for as much virtual interaction as we had at ICER this year!</p>
