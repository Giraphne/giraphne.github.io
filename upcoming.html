<p>Below, you can see upcoming events I'll attend. I hope to see you there!</p>


<h2>Spring Symposium</h2>
<i>Regensburg, Germany, March 4-5</i>
<p>I've been invited by the organisers of the symposium for the German Special Interest Group on Database Systems. I'll be discussing Data Systems Education and what (how?) we should be teaching in this new era of GenAI.</p>

<h2>EDBT/ICDT</h2>
<i>Tampere, Finland, March 24-27</i>
<p>I'm back in the organising committee of <a href="https://dataedinitiative.github.io/DataEd26/index.html" target="_blank">DataEd</a>, which is happening for the fifth time this year! We'll be colocated with EDBT/ICDT, to give opportunities to other attendees to join DataEd than we would normally have at SIGMOD. We have a lovely program (almost) ready for all attendees, so I hope to see you there! </p>
