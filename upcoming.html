<p>Below, you can see upcoming events I'll attend. I hope to see you there!</p>

<!-- <p>Due to the current pandemic, all offline events have been cancelled. Once something new comes up, I'll add it here.</p> -->


<h2>SIGCSE 2023</h2>
<i>Toronto, Canada, 15-18 March</i>
<p>It's still far away, but in March I'll be visiting Toronto. This is going to be my first experience at SIGCSE. It is much bigger than ICER, which might make it a bit harder to network. On the other hand, there are so many interesting events on the calendar that I should always be able to find someone with similar interests to me! At SIGCSE, I'll present a paper I wrote together with Toni Taipalus and Fenia, on how students experience engagement in an introductory Database course. Before the conference, I'll also be visiting UofT's Missisauga campus and Michael Liut. I'm very much looking forward to this trip!</p>

<h2>SIGMOD 2023</h2>
<i>Seattle, USA, 18-23 June</i>
<p>We're so excited to announce that our <a href="https://dataedinitiative.github.io/DataEd23/" target="_blank">DataEd workshop</a> will be held in collaboration with SIGMOD again this year. We were very happy with last year's attendance (up to 40 people) and submissions (19). For our second iteration we are aiming to access an even wider network of people, also including the statistics education research community. DataEd '23 will take place on the last day of SIGMOD: June 23, 2023. </p>
