<!-- <p>Below, you can see my upcoming visits. I hope to see you there!</p> -->

<p>Due to the current pandemic, all events have been cancelled. Once something new comes up, I'll add it here.</p>

<p>You can find me at my desk at home, probably wearing a headset.</p>

<!-- <h3>ICT.OPEN</h3>
<i>Groningen, March 17 and 18</i>
<p>It is almost time for ICT.OPEN again. This two day conference is organised by NWO (Dutch Research Council) and the ICT Research Platform for the Netherlands. I'll be presenting both my Alice&Eve poster, and a new poster on another part of my MSc Thesis work.</p>

<h3>SIGCHI 2020</h3>
<i>Honolulu, April 25-30</i>
<p>In April, I'll be visiting Hawai'i to be a Student Volunteer at CHI2020. I'm super excited, because it is my first real conference, and it will be a big one. There will be almost 4000 attendees and 174 fellow Student Volunteers. I don't think I can visualize how many people that is. I'm hoping to grow my network extensively, and to enjoy such a wonderful destination.</p>

<h3>PERL</h3>
<i>Leiden, May 19</i>
<p>I'll be visiting the Programming Education Research Lab at the Leiden Institute for Advanced Computer Science soon! The lab was started in 2019 and they research various aspects of Programming education in different age groups. I'll be presenting my Master Thesis work and hope that we can have some fruitful discussion.</p> -->
