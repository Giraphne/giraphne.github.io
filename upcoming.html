<h3>VL/HCC 2021</h3>
<i>Online, October 10-13</i>
<p>VL/HCC is a conference on Visual Languages and Human-Centered Computing. It is a great fit for presenting our work on <a href="https://pypi.org/project/sqlvis/">SQLVis</a>, a visual representation for SQL. More information on our visit to this conference will follow soon.</p>


<h3>Alice & Eve 2021</h3>
<i>Nijmegen, the Netherlands, November 12</i>
<p>After a succesful first version in January 2020, and a postponement of the 2021 version, in November it is finally time for Alice & Eve. It is a workshop to celebrate women in computing in the Netherlands, and it is a good venue to meet other students, PhD candidates and other academics within the country. This network broadening is one of the reasons I enjoyed Alice and Eve 2020 so much. This year, I will have another poster to present some work under review. </p>
