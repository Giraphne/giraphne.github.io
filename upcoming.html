<h2>ITiCSE 2025</h2>
<i>Nijmegen, the Netherlands, June 26 - July 2</i>
<p>I'm staying close to home this year with my attendance at ITiCSE, the ACM conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education. This is proceeded by the ITiCSE working groups, of which I'm co-organising one this year together with George Fletcher and Fenia Aivaloglou. We will be working on an analysis of Data Systems educational materials to identify metaphors, analogies and notional machines. Our report from last years Working Group has just been published, you can find it under my 2025 publications.
