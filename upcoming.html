<h3>Koli Calling 2021</h3>
<i>Online, November 18-21</i>
<p>Koli Calling is a single-track, small-but-international conference on Computer Science Education. Giving it it's name is hotel Koli (in Finland), where this conference is typically held. I have not been to this conference before, but my co-promotor Fenia mentioned that it is a good venue for networking, which is what I hope to do. I'll have a poster (+ abstract) to present a study design that I hope to discuss with the Koli community before I run it next year. I hope for as much virtual interaction as we had at ICER this year!</p>

<h3>Dutch-Belgian Database Day 2021 (DBDBD)</h3>
<i>Delft, the Netherlands, December 7</i>
<p>DBDBD is a one-day workshop in which database researchers from Belgium and the Netherlands meet up and share their research. The workshop has poster presentations, and no proceedings. It's main purpose is networking and connecting. I hope to also present, and share our ICER work on SQL Misconceptions.</p>
