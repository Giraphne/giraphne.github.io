<h2>Koli Calling</h2>
<i>Koli, Finland, November 13-19</i>
<p>In November it is time for another 'first': attending Koli Calling. Koli is a small CS Education research conference, taking place in Finland. The small setup hopefully allows for good conversations. Although getting to Koli requires quite a bit of travelling, I think it will be worth it to really be able to connect in a smaller community. </p>
