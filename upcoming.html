<p>Below, you can see upcoming events I'll attend. I hope to see you there!</p>


<h2>DataEd worskhop @ SIGMOD 2024</h2>
<i>Santiago, Chile, June 9</i>
<p>We are up to our third iteration of the DataEd workshop, and I'm so happy that it looks like it will be recurring for quite a few more years. The workshop is a venue for data systems educators and researchers to meet eachother, with the goal to support knowledge transfer about education to the classroom. If you are interested to learn more about DataEd, check out our <a target="_blank" href="dataedinitiative.github.io">website</a>. We are continuously adding information.</p>

<h2>Dagstuhl seminar 24251</h2>
<i>Schloss Dagstuhl, Germany, June 16 - 21</i>
<p>I'm so excited to have been invited to my first Dagstuhl! The topic is Teaching Support Systems for Formal Foundations of Computer Science. Our work on data systems fits with this well, and I'm looking forward to interesting discussions on computer science education that move beyond programming education.</p>


<h2>ITiCSE 2024</h2>
<i>Milan, Italy, July 5 - 10</i>
<p>Another new item on the calendar this year is my attendance at ITiCSE, the ACM conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education. This is proceeded by the ITiCSE working groups, of which I'm co-organising one this year together with Toni Taipalus. We will be working on an analysis of Data Systems curricula and their relation to industry needs, with a small group of invitees. As such, it has similar benefits to a Dagstuhl. To learn more about the concept of ITiCSE working groups, check out their <a target="_blank" href="https://iticse.acm.org/2024/working-groups/">website</a>. </p>

<h2>NII Shonan meeting 183</h2>
<i>Shonan Village Center, Japan, September 16 - 20</i>
<p>And the third invited seminar event I'm attending is the Shonan meeting with the theme Understanding the “Why” of Data and Knowledge Models. Although this theme is not well represented in my publications, it is something I have worked on in another context: the design and teaching of a course. I'm excited to learn more and discuss these topics in a new context. </p>
