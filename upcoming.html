<h3>ACM ICER 2021</h3>
<i>Online, August 16-19</i>
<p>ICER stands for International Computing Education Research conference and is supported by SIGCSE. The conference focuses on Computer Science Education, and some <a href="https://icer2021.acm.org/track/icer-2021-papers#Accepted-Papers">very interesting works</a> are on the program.</p>
<p>I'll also be presenting my first first-author publication at ICER! The presentation will be on August 19 in the session Talks A - Non-Standard Computing Topics. Presentation and paper (which will be published open access) will appear on my publications page soon.</p>


<h3>VL/HCC 2021</h3>
<i>Online, October 10-13</i>
<p>VL/HCC is a conference on Visual Languages and Human-Centered Computing. It is a great fit for presenting our work on <a href="https://pypi.org/project/sqlvis/">SQLVis</a>, a visual representation for SQL. More information on our visit to this conference will follow soon.</p>
