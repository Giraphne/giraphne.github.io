<p>Below, you can see upcoming events I'll attend. I hope to see you there!</p>

<h2>ICER 2022</h2>
<i>Lugano, Switzerland, August 7-11</i>
<p>ICER is an international conference for the Computer Science Education community. Now that it will be back in person, plus hosted in Europe, I look forward to attending in person for the first time. I had a good experience last year online, and hope that this year will be even better. </p>
