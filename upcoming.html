<p>Below, you can see upcoming events I'll attend. I hope to see you there!</p>

<!-- <p>Due to the current pandemic, all offline events have been cancelled. Once something new comes up, I'll add it here.</p> -->


<h2>Vakdidaktiekdag </h2>
<i>Utrecht, Netherlands, 22 September</i>
<p>After attending a couple of these gatherings for CSEd researchers in the Netherlands, I have volunteered to present at the next instance. I'll be talking about SQL complexity for novices, which is the topic of my dissertation.</p>

<h2>NordiCHI 2022</h2>
<i>Århus, Denmark, 8-12 October</i>
<p>It's been a goal of mine during the PhD to also connect with the CHI community. This year, I'm finally able to do this at NordiCHI. Although not as large as SIGCHI, I hope to meet researchers who also work in something related to Human-Data Interaction. I'm quite sure this will be successful, as I'll attend the NordiCHI workshop <a href="https://fermentingdata.net/nordichi22/" target="_blank">'Fermenting Data'</a> on Saturday, giving the conference a good kick-off! Then on Monday, my co-author Dennis Collaris and I will present our paper on <i>Characterizing Data Scientists’ Mental Models of Local Feature Importance</i>.</p>
