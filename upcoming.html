<h2>ICER 2023</h2>
<i>Chicago, USA, August 7-11</i>
<p>This year will mark my third time attending ICER! It is only the second time I'm visiting in-person, and I am really looking forward to it. Last year, I noticed that ICER was a great place for meeting people. The single-track nature, the table discussions and the attendance at the poster all reflect a highly engaged audience. This year, I'm participating in the Doctoral Consortium, as well as presenting a poster on our newest work: the development of a SQL misconception identification instrument!</p>
