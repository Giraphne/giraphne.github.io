<p>In 2025, a group of researchers worked on extracting notional machines for data systems topics, and I was one of them. Our work was inspired by a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3437800.3439202" target=""> previous working group report</a> on notional machines by Fincher et al. We investigated fourteen textbooks and nine of our own courses to extract various analogies and visual representations from it. </p>

<p>The outcome of our work is another <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3760545.3783971">working group report</a> named <i>Explanations of Data Systems Concepts in CS Education: An Updated View on Notional Machines.</i> </p>

<p>Currently, our notional machines are located <a href="https://lbusuttil-um.github.io" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
